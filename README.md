Provided is a high-level overview and some code snippets to get you started on how to design and implement a simple distributed application using sockets or middleware.

First, define a MessageHandler interface that both the server and the client will implement.

Next, create a Server class that listens for incoming client connections and sends messages back to the client.

Create a Client class that connects to the server and sends messages.

You can run the Server and Client classes in separate terminal windows. The client will prompt you to enter messages, and the server will echo them back.

Keep in mind that this is a basic example, and real-world applications may require more
advanced features like error handling, concurrency, and data validation. In this example, I am
using a single thread to handle each client connection, which can lead to performance issues if
there are many concurrent clients. To improve performance, you can use a thread pool or a non-
blocking I/O approach.

Another important consideration is security. In this example, I am not using any encryption or
authentication mechanisms, which means that the communication between the client and the
server can be intercepted or tampered with. To secure the communication, you can use SSL/TLS
or other encryption protocols.
